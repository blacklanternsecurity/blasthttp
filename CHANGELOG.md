# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Cookies set on a redirect hop are applied to the hops that follow it, the way a browser does. The jar is request-scoped, so nothing carries between requests
- `redirect_cookies=False` (or `--no-redirect-cookies`) reverts to the previous behavior

## 0.9.0

- `no_proxy` support — bypass the proxy for specific hosts, domains, IPs, or CIDRs
- `no_proxy` re-evaluated on every redirect hop
- `--rate-limit` CLI flag for batch mode

## 0.8.0

- `no_proxy` initial implementation (per-request)

## 0.7.0

- Fix duplicate Host header on pooled HTTP/2 connections

## 0.6.0

- Multipart file uploads (`files=` parameter, httpx-style)
- Reject `body` and `files` together with `ValueError`

## 0.5.0

- `blasthttp.mock` submodule for test fixtures (drop-in `BlastHTTP` replacement)
- httpx-style Response API — lazy `body`, `cookies`, `raw_headers`, `hash`
- `peer_ip` on every response and redirect hop

## 0.4.0

- `request_batch_stream()` — async iterator that yields results as they complete

## 0.3.0

- `blasthttp.h2` — permissive HPACK encoder/decoder and HTTP/2 frame builders
- HPACK decoder with dynamic table tracking
- RawConnection inherits client rate limiter

## 0.2.0

- Async Python API via `pyo3-async-runtimes`
- `RawConnection` for byte-level TCP/TLS I/O
- ALPN protocol negotiation on `raw_connect()`
- Proxy support for raw connections (HTTP CONNECT + SOCKS5)

## 0.1.1

- Initial release
- Batch HTTP client with connection pooling

- HTTP/2 via ALPN negotiation
- TLS cert extraction (CN, SANs, issuer)
- Response hashing (MD5, SHA256, MurmurHash3)
